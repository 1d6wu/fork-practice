# JavaScript Debugging Task

## ðŸ“– About This Task

This is a simple JavaScript debugging challenge.  
The code in `day5.js` has a few mistakes in it.

Your job is to:

1. **Clone the forked repo** using GitHub Desktop URL tab.
2. **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account.
    - Read the "How are you planning to use this fork?" information.
    - We plan to use this fork for a project not connected to the upstream, so clickÂ *For my own purposes*.
        - If you plan to use this fork to contribute to the original repository, clickÂ *To contribute to the parent project*.
3. Open `day5.js` in your code editor.
4. Find and fix the errors in the code.
5. Test the code using the console to make sure it works properly.
6. **Commit and push your changes** to your forked repo.
7. Check that your forked repository is visible on your GitHub profile.
8. Add a link for your forked repository in the Discussion Board's Google Sheets (in Column D).

## ðŸ’¾ When You're Done

Commit your changes with a clear message like: *Fix errors in day5.js*

Then push your changes back to your forked repo.

Good luck â€” and happy debugging!
